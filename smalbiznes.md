# CYBER ATTACKS SMALL BUSINESSES ARE EXPOSED TO

1. Install, use and regularly update antivirus and antispyware software on every computer used in your business. Use a firewall for your Internet connection. Download and install software updates for your operating systems and applications as they become available.
2. Malware:
Malware is term that is used to describe a variety of cyber threats including viruses, bots, spyware, trojans and worms. Simply put, malware is code written with malicious intent designed to steal or destroy data on a computer or network. It’s typically introduced to a computer through email attachments, software downloads or network vulnerabilities.
3. Phishing:
Phishing is the practice of sending emails purporting to be from reputable companies in order to induce the recipients to reveal personal information such as usernames, passwords and even credit card numbers. Phishing emails often look legitimate, like a bank email for example, and will usually ask the recipient to click through to a copycat website to enter their login information or update payment information – where the creator can then steal it.

4. Password Attacks:
A password attack is when a third party tries to gain access to a computer system or network by cracking a user’s password. This type of attack does not usually involve any type of malicious code or software to be installed on a system, but instead uses software on the attacker’s computer that is capable of cracking passwords using information provided by the attacker.
