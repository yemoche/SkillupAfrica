**User Observer** pattern is a type of design pattern that shows a one to many dependency. The one here is referring to me as a Subject(object) and many dependencies are my Subscribers (Objects).

#Application of the User Observer Pattern:

My Company is into telecommunication service,and we provide various services such as data packages and internet services. just recently, we had an issue with one of our servers system, and such really caused a lot of problems to our many subscribers, they were many delays in browsing of internet, sending of e-messages, sending of text messages,e.t.c. Infact, this also spiralled into the financial institutions and such affected many commercial sevices.
During the process of resolving these issues, we notified our customers on reasons they are having problem with our webservices.Also, after the correction was made, we notify our subscribers that our respective webservices are back, also they should update most of their operational system  as we have done upgrade of our telecommunication system agaisnt any future hacker attacks.
