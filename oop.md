Polymorphism - means having many forms, which is dependent on what is put. polymorphism is an object program (a program is a set of instructions given to a computer to do, for example your Samsung toy pad, and so on). 
your customize Monica toy pad is an object, your Monica's toy pad has another parent called Samsung toy pad (we call it class, it is from here that your customize pad gets all its program from).

less, i forget you told me your friends Chinwe,kafaya,Okon all have a new toy pads, and you have always been able to use them without any issues. The ability of you been able to use them, is what is called Polymorphism (though those pads may have different maker, still you are able to operate them is what polymorphism simple means).

Polymorphism could be dynamic or static, when we say static, it means not changing, while dynamic means changing.

* Static polymorhism means your object(toy pad) can only work based on what it was programmed to do. I remebered you told me Chinwe's toy pad cannot record voice and play music.wait,for a moment, you will now see why your toy pad was customized. this program is fixed because of its class behaviour and attributes.

* Dynamic Polymorphism your object(toy pad) can work in different ways, your toy pad can play old and new songs, it can read ABC, 123, sing new rhymes, and so on. that is call dynamic, this happened because of its large class properties and beahviour.
